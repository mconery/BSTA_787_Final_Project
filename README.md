# BSTA_787_Final_Project

This repository contains all code as well as the cell type annotations needed to replicate the results of my 
#batch correction and differential expression analysis of the pancreatic islet datasets published by 
Baron et al. (2016), Segerstolpe et al. (2016), Muraro et al. (2016), Grun et al. (2016), and Lawlor et al. (2017).  

A couple of notes:

  > The raw data sets for the analysis can be found at http://scanorama.csail.mit.edu/data.tar.gz and can be downloaded using wget.  

  > The python scripts are intended to be run from the command line with user defined parameters.  Descriptions of how each script 
    operates are included at the top of the files, and usage examples are shown in the corresponding .sh files.  

  > The analyze_DE_tests.R file is meant to be run from the command line with input parameters as well, but the analyze_T2D_DE_test.R
    script will require manual editing to run.
